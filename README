This is a failed attempt to display the content of a webpage in quicklook from a .webloc file. It's a failed attempt because quicklook doesn't allow network access. However this project would become useful if Apple removes this restriction :)

In the commits I outline what I attempted to get this to work. I first tried NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:, no luck. So then I thought I was clever and tried to use the command line tool curl, but that didn't work either.

If anyone has an idea of how to get this to work that would be awesome :)

Until then we'll just wait for Apple to enable internet access for Quick Look. If they do enable this, this project should work as is. I was able to use my WeblocData object to load a webpage in a standard application window.
